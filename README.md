# Pastanaga 3

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.2.1.

## Development

This workspace contains two projects:

- documentation is an app containing Pastanaga documentation
- ngx-pastanaga is the lib containing all the reusable UI components

When developing, you need to run the application as well as to build the lib whenever you make a change. To avoid doing it manually, run:

```bash
npm run watch
```

The lib will automatically be rebuilt whenever you modify any of the lib source files.

Then, you can start a local development server:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests, use the following command:

```bash
npm run test
```
